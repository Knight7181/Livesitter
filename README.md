## Text and Image Positioning Demo with Flask and MongoDB
This is a simple web application built with Flask, MongoDB, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript that allows users to overlay text and images onto a video embedded from rtsp.me. It's a demonstration of how you can dynamically position and style text and images on a video stream.

### Features
Video Embedding: The application embeds a video from rtsp.me using an iframe.

Text Manipulation: Users can enter text, choose font size, font color, and position for the text on the video. The text is overlaid onto the video in real-time.

Image Manipulation: Users can upload an image (logo) and position it on the video. They can also resize the image as needed.

Persistence: Text entered by users is saved to a MongoDB database, allowing the most recent text to be displayed even after refreshing the page.
